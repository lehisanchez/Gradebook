# Gradebook

Gradebook is a Ruby on Rails application that allows Teachers to create courses with assignments. Students can enroll in courses and submit assignments for a grade.

This application mimics features found in Canvas, the online learning platform my college uses. Gradebook was my Final Project for a programming course I took in the Spring 2020 semester.

## Personal Goals
